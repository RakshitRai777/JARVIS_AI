# JARVIS_AI 🧠✨

A lightweight, multimodal AI assistant inspired by Iron Man’s JARVIS.  
This project integrates cutting-edge open-source models to provide text, image, and voice-based interactions — all running locally without dependency on external APIs.

---

## 🚀 Features
- **Voice Activation**: Wake-word detection for hands-free use.
- **Multimodal Input/Output**: Supports text, speech, and image generation.
- **Local Deployment**: CPU-only optimized workflows, no GPU/API required.
- **Prompt Benchmarking**: Comprehensive suite to test fidelity, adherence, and edit consistency.
- **Customizable Personality**: Context-aware responses with personality-driven interactions.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python 3.9+**
- **Groq / GPT-OSS-120B / LLaMA** (text models)
- **Stable Diffusion / Stable Video Diffusion** (media generation)
- **SpeechRecognition + PyAudio** (voice input)
- **Flask / FastAPI** (web interface)
- **Git LFS** (for large model files)
